# Importing project's non-default branch from Github to Glitch

Use the import option to import the project to Glitch. This will clone only the `master` or default branch. To checkout to any other branch of your repo, fire up the Glitch console and run `git checkout --track origin/branchname` and Voila! The `branchname` branch is now running on Glitch.
